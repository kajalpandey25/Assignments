## what is RDBMS? Why do industries use RDBMS?

**Ans**
```
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is a type of software that manages data stored in a relational database. In a relational database, data is organized into tables, with each table consisting of rows and columns. The relationships between tables are defined by the data in the tables.

Industries use RDBMS for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons is that RDBMS provides a way to store and manage large amounts of structured data in a secure, efficient, and scalable manner. RDBMS also allows users to access and manipulate data in a flexible way, using a variety of querying and reporting tools.
