A file-based storage system is a type of data storage system that stores data in individual files. In this system, each file is given a unique name, and the files are organized in a hierarchical structure.

1. One of the major challenges of a file-based storage system is its lack of scalability. As the number of files stored increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage and organize them. Additionally, file-based systems are typically limited in terms of the types of queries that can be performed on the data.

2. Another challenge is the lack of security features. Without proper security measures, files can be easily accessed, modified, or deleted by unauthorized users. Furthermore, backups and disaster recovery procedures can be difficult to implement in a file-based system.

3. Finally, file-based systems can be inefficient when dealing with large amounts of data. Retrieving and updating individual files can be time-consuming, particularly when dealing with large files or datasets.
