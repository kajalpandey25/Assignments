Data modeling is the process of creating a conceptual representation of data and its relationships to other data in a structured way. The purpose of data modeling is to help stakeholders understand and communicate the data requirements of an organization or application.

There are several types of data modeling, including:

1. Conceptual data modeling: Conceptual data modeling focuses on the high-level relationships between data entities, independent of any specific database technology. It provides a broad overview of the data requirements of an organization or application.

2. Logical data modeling: Logical data modeling involves translating the conceptual data model into a model that can be implemented in a specific database technology, such as a relational database. It focuses on the specific data structures, relationships, and constraints required for the application.

3. Physical data modeling: Physical data modeling involves defining the physical database schema, including table structures, indexes, and other physical storage details. It is closely tied to a specific database technology and is often performed by database administrators.
