1. Data redundancy: In a file-based system, data may be duplicated across multiple files, leading to redundancy and inconsistencies. DBMS solves this issue by providing a centralized database where data can be stored in a structured and organized manner, eliminating redundancy.

2. Data inconsistency: In a file-based system, it is difficult to maintain consistency across multiple files. For example, if the same data item is stored in multiple files, there is a risk of the data becoming inconsistent if one file is updated but not the other. DBMS ensures data consistency by implementing data validation rules, enforcing constraints, and using transactions.

3. Limited access control: In a file-based system, it may be difficult to control access to individual files and ensure data security. DBMS provides access control features, such as user authentication and authorization, to ensure that only authorized users can access data.

4. Limited query capabilities: In a file-based system, querying data can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex queries involving multiple files. DBMS provides powerful query capabilities, allowing users to retrieve and analyze data using SQL and other query languages.

5. Lack of scalability: In a file-based system, as the number of files and data size increases, it becomes difficult to manage and maintain the system. DBMS provides scalability features, such as indexing and partitioning, that allow the system to handle large amounts of data efficiently.
